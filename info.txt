The preload directory is a directory where you put your scripts that need to be loaded before the oh my zsh framework
Usually used for oh my zsh settings (these settings need to be set before oh my zsh loads) for instance a oh my zsh plugin / theme

All the scripts directly in this directory are loaded after the oh my zsh framework.
If it doesn't configure oh my zsh then put your files here

NOTE:
You can create files in either directory and those filles will be autoloaded you don't need to change the ~/.zshrc file manually to include new scripts
note that these scripts must end with .sh otherwise the file won't be loaded in the ~/.zshrc
this is done to prevent unwanted files to be included (for instance this file)
If you wise to include other files change the load function located in the ~/.zshrc file to include that file type
